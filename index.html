                    Cicadas are oval-shaped, winged insects that provide a buzzing and clicking song heard in nature
                    <br>
                    throughout the summer. Most cicadas appear every year in late June through August, while others
                    <br>
                    emerge only every few years.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Cicadas are found throughout the U.S. (and many parts of the world), but periodical cicadas —
                    <br>
                    the species that emerge above ground only every few years — live primarily in the eastern and
                    <br>
                    central U.S.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Cicadas can live a relatively long time: 4 to 17 years, depending on whether they are annual or
                    <br>
                    periodical cicadas. The periodical cicadas live the longest.

                    The giant panda's distinct black-and-white markings have two functions: camouflage and
                    communication.
                    <br>
                    Most of the panda - its face, neck, belly, rump - is white to help it hide in snowy habitats.
                    <br>
                    The arms and legs are black, helping it to hide in shade.

                    Mother pandas keep contact with their cub nearly 100% of the time during their first month -
                    <br>
                    with the cub resting on her front and remaining covered by her paw, arm or head.

                    Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.

                    Pigeons mate for life, and tend to raise two chicks at the same time.

                <li>
                    Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than

                    humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.

                    The incident of Roosevelt sparing the bear led to the popularity and naming of Teddy bears.

                    The story of Goldilocks And The Three Bears was written in 1837 by Robert Southey who was the Poet
